### Weather Application

This HTML and JavaScript code snippet provides a simple weather application interface. Users can enter a city name, and it fetches current weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. The weather icon and details update dynamically based on the API response.

### How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Enter a city name in the search box and click the search button.
4. The application will display the current weather information for the entered city.

### Notes

- Ensure you have a valid OpenWeatherMap API key (`apikey`) to fetch weather data.
- Modify the weather icon URLs (`weatherIcon.src`) based on your application's requirements.

Feel free to customize and expand this application according to your needs!
